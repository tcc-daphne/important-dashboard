# 3 Goals and 8 Principles

TCC's three goals are to *function as One College*, *be Student Ready*, and *Serve the Community*.


## The eight principles are:

**Learning Commons**: Learning Commons are an integrated component with the College-wide active learning experience and foster greater student engagement by meeting student needs in a dynamic and flexible environment.

**Integrated Instructional Learning Environments**: The College embraces a culture of teaching and learning as the foundation of its mission, and supporting innovation in space, technology, and teaching practices serves as the core for student learning and success.

**Integrated Student Success Model**: The College dedicates significant resources focused on student success including faculty and staff, space, equipment, and technology.

**Student Experience**: A Student-Ready College provides an experience for students that is welcoming, simple to understand, provides a clear pathway, and breaks down barriers.

**High Schools**: Building and maintaining strong P-20 partnerships is essential for the student pathways to success.

**Scheduling and Facility Utilization**: A student-centered schedule of classes is offered and supports student access and success.

**Campus Character and Quality**: A Student-Ready College provides a welcoming and easily navigated experience for students and uses space effectively to maximize the student experience.

**Workspace Environments**: Redesigned workspace environments will promote more collegiality, enhance spatial quality, provide flexibility and increased efficiency, and support a culture of collaboration.
